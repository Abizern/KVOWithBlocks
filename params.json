{"google":"","tagline":"KVO with a block instead of a callback","body":"# KVOWithBlocks\r\n\r\nA category on NSObject that allows you observe a keypath passing in a block to\r\nexecute when the keypath changes instead of using a callback method.\r\n\r\nWhy? Blocks are funky. They let you define an action at the same time as you are\r\nsetting up a observation. In most cases this leads to clearer code than using a\r\ncallback.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n_Add something here_\r\n\r\n## Branch structure for submodules\r\n\r\nThere are two branches to this repository, *master* and *development*, these\r\nmake it easier to use the same repository for developing as well as for sharing\r\nthe code as a Git submodule.\r\n\r\n### The master branch\r\n\r\nThe master branch just contains the class category and this README file. It is\r\nthe one to use if you want to add it as a submodule to your project. This should\r\nbe treated as a readonly branch. *do not perform any development on this\r\nbranch*.\r\n\r\nif you are using this as a submodule, keep up to date with the latest changes by\r\n\r\n### The development branch\r\n\r\nThe development branch contains the category files as well as Xcode projects for\r\ndevelopment and demonstration. This is the branch where development should be\r\nperformed, the changes push back to the master branch cleanly through the magic\r\nof careful merging.\r\n\r\nTo add the development branch rather than master, simply use the -b flag when\r\ncloning, as shown below.\r\n\r\n    git submodule add -b production << URL for repository >>\r\n\r\n### Artefacts\r\n\r\nSometimes, there may be artefacts left over when switching from master to\r\ndevelopment. These are files that are ignored by Git and are easily cleaned up\r\nby running\r\n\r\n    git clean -dxf\r\n\r\n## License (MIT)\r\n\r\nStandard MIT licence.\r\n\r\nI don't need attribution, it's only a small bit of code. Be inspired to write\r\nyour own block based replacements.\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nBased on:\r\n+ [KVO+Blocks](https://gist.github.com/153676) by Andy Matuschak\r\n+ [DGKVOBlocks](https://github.com/dannygreg/DGKVOBlocks) by Danny Greg\r\n\r\nI make no apologies for taking the bits I like from them.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
